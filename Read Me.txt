After you have finished setting up mpv with my config, play a video. Once you have opened a video file, press "I" to check if HW: vulkan displays correctly. If this is missing, your video card doesn't support vulkan and you must change it to vaapi in the mpv.config file.


If you plan to stream mpv on Discord for example, please use ao=pulse.
